# Voice Cloning with Local LLMs

## Implementation Approach
1. **Local Model Hosting**: All voice cloning models will run on local infrastructure
2. **Privacy Protection**: Voice samples never leave the local environment
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Local LLMs can be fine-tuned with user-specific data

## Technical Requirements
1. Hardware requirements for local model inference
2. Model optimization techniques for local deployment
3. Privacy-preserving data processing pipelines

## Benefits
1. Complete data privacy and security
2. Opportunity to learn model optimization techniques
3. Customizable to specific use cases through local fine-tuning
