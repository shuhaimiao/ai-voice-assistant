# Voice Cloning with Local LLMs

## Implementation Approach
1. **Local Model Hosting**: All voice cloning models run on local infrastructure using Coqui TTS (XTTS v2)
2. **Privacy Protection**: Voice samples never leave the local environment
3. **Zero-Shot Learning**: Uses reference audio samples for direct voice cloning without additional training

## Current Implementation Details

### Model Selection
- **Coqui XTTS v2**: State-of-the-art voice cloning capabilities
- **Zero-Shot Learning**: Clones voice from a single audio sample
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles various languages through language code parameter

### Technical Requirements
- **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.11 (not compatible with Python 3.12+)
- **Dependencies**: TTS library (version 0.22.0 or higher)
- **Hardware**: CPU for basic functionality, GPU recommended for faster inference
- **Reference Sample**: Minimum 3 seconds of clear audio (10 seconds recommended)

### PyTorch Compatibility Notice
For PyTorch 2.6+, a patch is required in the TTS library's io.py file to set `weights_only=False` when loading model checkpoints. See `docs/guidelines/python_setup.md` for detailed instructions.

## Phased Implementation with TDD Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Voice Sample Processing ✅
**Test Cases**
1. [x] Test empty/invalid audio file detection
2. [x] Test minimum duration validation
3. [x] Test sample rate validation
4. [x] Test noise detection threshold

**Implementation Steps**
1. [x] Implement secure voice sample collection with validation
2. [x] Develop preprocessing pipeline (now handled by XTTS model)
3. [x] Create privacy-preserving storage solution (using local file system)
4. [x] Write integration tests for complete pipeline

### Current Progress
- Voice sample validation implemented in VoiceCloning class
- XTTS v2 model integration complete
- Demo script working with 10-second voice sample collection
- All tests updated and passing with proper mocking
- Python version compatibility issues resolved
- PyTorch 2.6+ compatibility patch documented

### Phase 2: Voice Cloning Model Implementation ✅
**Completed Steps**
1. [x] Selected appropriate architecture (Coqui XTTS v2)
2. [x] Implemented model loading and initialization
3. [x] Developed voice cloning interface
4. [x] Created comprehensive tests with proper mocking

**Technical Implementation**
- TextToSpeech base class handles core TTS functionality
- VoiceCloning class extends base functionality with cloning support
- Reference audio (speaker_wav) used for voice characteristics
- Language parameter enables multilingual support

### Phase 3: Quality Validation Pipeline
**Next Steps**
1. [ ] Test voice similarity metrics
2. [ ] Implement automated quality scoring
3. [ ] Develop human evaluation framework
4. [ ] Create iterative improvement feedback loop

### Phase 4: System Integration
**Next Steps**
1. [ ] Design more robust error handling
2. [ ] Optimize model loading time
3. [ ] Add caching for frequently used voices
4. [ ] Implement batch processing capability

## Usage Example
```python
from tts.voice_cloning import VoiceCloning

# Initialize voice cloning
vc = VoiceCloning()

# Clone voice from reference audio and generate speech
vc.clone_voice(
    text="This is spoken in a voice that sounds like the reference audio.",
    reference_audio="path/to/reference_sample.wav",
    language="en",
    output_path="cloned_voice_output.wav"
)
```

## Benefits
1. Complete data privacy and security (all processing happens locally)
2. High-quality voice cloning without training
3. Flexible voice selection by simply changing the reference audio
4. Multilingual support through language parameter
