# ADR 0002: Voice Cloning Implementation

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our text-to-speech system needs voice cloning capabilities to allow users to generate speech in custom voices. The Coqui XTTS v2 model provides this functionality but requires careful implementation of voice sample processing and quality validation.

## Decision
We will implement voice cloning with the following components:
1. **Voice Sample Processing Pipeline**:
   - Basic validation (format, duration, sample rate)
   - LLM-assisted noise reduction and enhancement
   - Automated quality scoring using both traditional metrics and LLM analysis

2. **Model Integration**:
   - Use Coqui XTTS v2 for voice embedding generation
   - Implement optional fine-tuning capability

3. **Quality Assurance**:
   - Pre-generation validation of voice samples
   - Post-generation quality checks
   - LLM-based similarity scoring between input samples and output

## Consequences
### Positive
- Enables custom voice generation
- LLM assistance improves sample quality
- Automated validation reduces manual review

### Negative
- Increased computational requirements
- Additional dependencies (XTTS v2, LLM services)
- More complex error handling

### Risks
- Potential quality degradation with poor samples
- LLM processing latency
- Model training failures
