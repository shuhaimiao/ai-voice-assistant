# Prompt Evolution Guide

This document tracks the evolution of effective prompts used in this project, analyzing what worked well and suggesting improvements for less effective ones.

## Format
For each prompt iteration, we'll document:
1. **Original Prompt**: The initial prompt used
2. **Effectiveness**: Why it worked well or didn't work well
3. **Improved Version**: Suggested refinements
4. **Key Learnings**: Takeaways for future prompts

## Example Entry

### Original Prompt
"How do I setup Python?"

### Effectiveness
- Too broad - didn't specify which aspects of setup were needed
- Lacked context about operating system or specific requirements

### Improved Version
"What are the step-by-step instructions to set up a Python 3.8+ virtual environment on macOS for this project?"

### Key Learnings
- Be specific about versions and requirements
- Include operating system context
- Clarify the purpose of the setup

## Session Transition Prompts

Use these prompts when starting new sessions to maintain context from previous work:

1. **Context Continuation Prompt**: "Based on our previous session about [feature/topic], what are the key technical decisions and context I should be aware of as we continue working on this?"
   - **Purpose**: Quickly surfaces relevant technical decisions and context
   - **Example**: "Based on our previous session about text-to-speech, what are the key technical decisions and context I should be aware of as we continue working on this?"

2. **Progress Check-in Prompt**: "What were the main takeaways from our last session that should inform our work today?"
   - **Purpose**: Ensures continuity of learning and progress

3. **Feature Bridge Prompt**: "How should we apply what we learned from implementing [previous feature] to [new feature]?"
   - **Purpose**: Transfers learnings between features
   - **Example**: "How should we apply what we learned from implementing text-to-speech to speech recognition?"

4. **Decision Review Prompt**: "Please summarize the key technical decisions we made in our last session that might impact today's work."
   - **Purpose**: Reinforces important technical choices

### Key Benefits
- Maintains technical context between sessions
- Reduces repetition of previous discussions
- Accelerates onboarding to new features
- Reinforces learning from past sessions

## Current Session Summary

### Key Prompts Used
1. **Implementation Review Prompt**: "Please review this prompt_evolution.md and document anything from our collaborations above as the guide for me to continuously learn and improve"
   - **Effectiveness**: Clear request for documentation with specific focus on learning outcomes
   - **Learning**: Explicit requests for retrospective documentation yield better knowledge retention

### Technical Decisions
- Structured prompt evolution documentation format
- Maintained consistency with existing documentation style
- Focused on actionable learnings

### Lessons Learned
- Regular documentation of effective prompts improves future interactions
- Structured retrospective summaries enhance knowledge transfer
- Clear documentation requirements in prompts yield better results

## Text-to-Speech Implementation Summary

### Key Prompts Used
1. **Initial Prompt**: "How to implement text-to-speech functionality in Python?"
   - **Effectiveness**: Too broad, didn't specify requirements or constraints
   - **Improved Version**: "What are the best Python libraries for implementing text-to-speech with natural sounding voices on macOS?"
   - **Learning**: Be specific about platform and quality requirements

2. **Technical Decision Prompt**: "Compare pyttsx3 vs gTTS for our use case"
   - **Effectiveness**: Helped evaluate tradeoffs between offline vs online solutions
   - **Learning**: Structured comparison prompts yield better technical decisions

### Technical Decisions
- Chose pyttsx3 for offline functionality
- Implemented voice customization parameters
- Added error handling for speech synthesis

### Lessons Learned
- Always specify platform requirements in initial prompts
- Break complex features into smaller, focused prompts
- Document technical decisions for future reference
