# Prompt Evolution Guide

This document tracks the evolution of effective prompts used in this project, analyzing what worked well and suggesting improvements for less effective ones.

## Format
For each prompt iteration, we'll document:
1. **Original Prompt**: The initial prompt used
2. **Effectiveness**: Why it worked well or didn't work well
3. **Improved Version**: Suggested refinements
4. **Key Learnings**: Takeaways for future prompts

## Example Entry

### Original Prompt
"How do I setup Python?"

### Effectiveness
- Too broad - didn't specify which aspects of setup were needed
- Lacked context about operating system or specific requirements

### Improved Version
"What are the step-by-step instructions to set up a Python 3.8+ virtual environment on macOS for this project?"

### Key Learnings
- Be specific about versions and requirements
- Include operating system context
- Clarify the purpose of the setup
